Abstract :
This project aims to develop a real-time system for classifying and correcting common yoga poses using machine learning. By utilizing Mediapipe for pose landmark detection and Random Forest for classification, it ensures accurate recognition of user posture. The system helps users maintain correct form during yoga practice without needing constant supervision. Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques enhance model performance across varied conditions. This solution promotes safe, self-guided yoga practice and encourages the integration of technology into personal wellness.
